# Functions-Events-and-Update-Limiter
I was working on a school project that required some classes that I could not find online.
I have decided to upload these files for anyone looking for a simple solution to some of the following issues:
  - Handling functions and storing them for later (FuncHelper)
  - Handling simple Events using the funcHelper class (EventHelper)
  - Having a simple way to limit the update speed of a specific thread (UpdateLimiter)
  - Having a simple way to use functions that will terminate at a later time (TerminatingFunction)
    - This is an alternate way to "multi-thread"
      - This is a simple way to do something over time without using threads or coroutines

Once again, this is not in any way meant to be perfect!
These are some of the simple classes that I made while working on a school project that I thought might be useful for others.
